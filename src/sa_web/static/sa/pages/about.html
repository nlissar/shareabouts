There is a lot going on in the Upper West Side's sidewalks.  In order
to create a more walkable, livable neighborhood, CB7 is collecting
information about the place we live in.

</p>

<ul>
<li>Schools</li>
<li>Sidewalk cracks</li>
<li>SROs (Single-Room Occupancy)</li>
</ul>

Every resident is a local expert! Please use this map to tell us about
things you see.

Submit locations you know. With your help, we will all have a better
