<h1>About</h1>

<p>Hello! You're looking at a demo of Shareabouts, a mapping project from <a
  href="http://openplans.org/civicworks">OpenPlans</a>.</p>

<p>In this demo here, we're showing how Shareabouts can be used to survey
  the usage of a public space. These analytics can be used to highlight where
  spaces are working well and where they could be improved, as well as offer
  insights into who the space is serving and when.</p>

<p>Shareabouts is a simple web app for crowdsourced mapping. You can use it to
  collect public input on maps - for example, where should a new park be built?
  Which bus stops need a new shelter? People can put dots on the map, add
  comments, discuss other people's suggestions and share locations over social
  networks.</p>

<p>Read more about Shareabouts at <a
  href="http://shareabouts.org/">shareabouts.org</a>, or head to <a
  href="https://github.com/openplans/shareabouts/">Shareabouts on github</a>.
  The project is <a href="https://github.com/openplans/shareabouts/">open
  source</a>, and we welcome your involvement.</p>

<p>Thanks for trying out Shareabouts!</p>
