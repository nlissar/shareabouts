<h1>About</h1>

<p>Hello! This is an online survey tool by the Bicycle Coalition of Greater
Philadelphia. We're collecting information about bicycle infrastructure and
we need your help!</p>

<p>This survey will help us estimate how many bicycles can be parked at SEPTA's
rail stations. This will give the us better information parking availability so
we can target our outreach more effectively.</p>

<p>This tool is being powered by Shareabouts, a simple web app for crowdsourced
  mapping. You can use it to collect public input on maps - either by adding new
  places or surveying existing ones. People can comment, discuss other people's
  suggestions, and express support. Read more about Shareabouts at
  <a href="http://shareabouts.org/">shareabouts.org</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
