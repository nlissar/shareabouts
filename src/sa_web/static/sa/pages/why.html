<h1>What is Shareabouts?</h1>

<p>Shareabouts is a simple web app for crowdsourced mapping. You can use it to
  collect public input on maps. People can put dots on the map, add
  comments, discuss other people's suggestions.</p>

<ul>
  <li>gather suggestions for possible locations for bike share stations</li>
  <li>get comments and votes on proposed locations for food carts</li>
  <li>collect data on vacant lots that could be urban farms</li>
  <li>show infrastructure options and get public comment on each one</li>

  <li>crowdsource issue reporting after a storm</li>
</ul>
