<h1>About</h1>

<p>
Hello! You're looking at a demo of Shareabouts, a mapping project from
<a href="http://openplans.org">OpenPlans.</a>
</p>

<p>
In this demo here, we're showing how Shareabouts can be used to
gather multiple types of information about a single area.
</p>

<p>
There is a lot going on in Manhattan's Upper West Side.  In order to
create a more walkable, livable neighborhood, Community Board 7 (CB7)
is collecting information about the place we live in.
</p>

<p>Some of the information we're tracking:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Schools</li>
<li>Sidewalk cracks</li>
<li>SROs (Single-Room Occupancy)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Every resident is a local expert! Please use this map to tell us about
things you see.
</p>

<p>
Submit locations you know. With your help, we will all have a better
understanding of local probems in the Upper West Side.
